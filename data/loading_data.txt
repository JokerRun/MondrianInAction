Loading Adventure Works files:

1. In mysql create a database to load into since the backups don't create the database.  For example:
mysql> create database adventure_works_dw;
mysql> use adventure_works_dw;

2. Load the file.  There are a number of ways, but if you are already using the database, then use the following:
mysql> source adventure_works_dw.mysql;

Load Foodmart

Use standard Mondrian  method for loading foodmart into mysql
